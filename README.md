# ABSTRACT
The relationship between bond kinetics and mechanical properties of bonds between the selectin family of proteins and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 are important in the biological process of leukocyte adhesion. Previous studies have shown that selectin bonds exhibit catch behavior at the single molecule level and ideal behavior when multiple bonds interact in a cluster. However, the internal mechanisms that cause this ideal behavior remains unknown. To explore these mechanisms, a one state two pathway model was developed assuming that the bonds were linear springs and could rebind after rupturing. This model was developed to resolve contradicting conclusions about the behavior of catch bonds on a cluster and aimed to explain  the experimentally observed behavior of a catch bonds cluster. However, the model was unable to predict ideal behavior for a catch bond cluster when experimental data from a previous study was fitted for single bonds and  bond clusters simultaneously. The results demonstrated that assumptions about tether elasticity and rebinding rates cause a cluster of selectin catch bonds to exhibit catch behavior.
